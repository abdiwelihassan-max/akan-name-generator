# 🌍 Akan Name Generator

An interactive web application that generates a "traditional Ghanaian Akan name" based on a user’s **date of birth** and **gender**.

In Akan culture, children are named according to the **day of the week** they were born. These names carry cultural meaning and are believed to reflect personality traits and identity.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was built to practice:

- JavaScript logic and functions  
- Date validation  
- DOM manipulation  
- User input handling  
- Implementing a cultural-based algorithm  

The app calculates the **day of the week** a user was born and assigns the corresponding Akan name.

## ✨ Features

- 📅 Calculates the correct **weekday** from a birth date  
- 👤 Assigns **male or female Akan names**  
- ✅ Validates user input (day, month, year, gender)  
- 🌙 Proper **leap year handling**  
- ⚡ Instant result display  
- 🚫 Error alerts for invalid entries
